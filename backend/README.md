 # FastAPI Backend

 This folder contains the FastAPI backend for the HealthAid project. The README focuses on developer setup, local run instructions, migrations, and developer tooling (formatters/linting/pre-commit).

 ## Repository layout (important files)

 - `main.py` — FastAPI app entrypoint used by Uvicorn.
 - `run.py` — convenience script that starts Uvicorn and reads `PORT` from settings.
 - `requirements.txt` — pinned Python dependencies used in runtime and CI.
 - `pyproject.toml` — ruff/black configuration.
 - `alembic/` — database migrations and `alembic.ini`.
 - `app/` — application package (routers, models, config).
 - `Dockerfile` — backend container image definition.

 ## Environment & secrets

 The application uses `pydantic-settings` and reads an `.env` file by default (see `app/api/core/config.py`). Required environment variables:

 - `DATABASE_URL` — full SQLAlchemy-compatible database URL (e.g. `postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@host:5432/dbname` or `mysql+mysqlconnector://user:pass@host:3306/dbname`).
 - `SECRET_KEY` — secret used for signing tokens.
 - `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` — integer (token expiry minutes).
 - `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS` — integer (refresh token expiry days).
 - `PORT` — port the app listens on (default: `8000`).

 Create a `.env` file at the `backend/` root (or set variables in your shell). Example `.env` (DO NOT commit secrets):

 ```dotenv
 # .env (example)
 DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://healthaid:password@localhost:5432/healthaid_db
 SECRET_KEY=replace_this_with_a_secure_random_string
 ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=60
 REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS=7
 PORT=8000
 ```

 Tip: Use a secrets manager for production or docker-compose environment variables rather than committing `.env` to source control.

 ## Quick local setup

 1. Create and activate a virtual environment (macOS / zsh example):

 ```bash
 python -m venv .venv
 source .venv/bin/activate
 ```

 2. Install runtime and developer dependencies:

 ```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 pip install ruff black pre-commit
 ```

 3. Create `.env` as shown above and ensure your local DB is running and reachable using `DATABASE_URL`.

 4. Run migrations (see next section) then start the app:

 ```bash
 # run migrations
 alembic upgrade head

 # start the API for development
 uvicorn main:app --reload
 ```

 Alternatively you can run `python run.py` which uses `app` settings for the port.

 ## Database & Migrations (Alembic)

 Alembic is configured under `alembic/`. The `alembic/env.py` loads environment variables using `python-dotenv` and expects `DATABASE_URL` to be present. Basic workflow:

 ```bash
 # create an autogenerated revision after model changes
 alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe change"

 # apply migrations to the database
 alembic upgrade head

 # show current heads
 alembic heads

 # downgrade one revision
 alembic downgrade -1
 ```

 If you run into issues, ensure `DATABASE_URL` is exported in your shell or present in the `.env` file in the `backend/` folder.

 ## Docker & docker-compose

 The repository contains a `Dockerfile` for the backend and a top-level `docker-compose.yml` to orchestrate services (backend, database, frontend, etc.). To build and run the backend in Docker (example):

 ```bash
 # from repository root
 docker-compose up --build backend
 ```

 Adjust service names in the compose file as needed. When running in Docker, pass environment variables via the compose file or a `.env` referenced by compose.

 ## Formatting, linting, and pre-commit

 We recommend the following tools for local development: `ruff` (linter and quick fixer), `black` (formatter), and `pre-commit` (git hooks).

 Common commands:

 ```bash
 # Format files with ruff's formatter
 ruff format .

 # Run ruff and automatically fix fixable issues
 ruff check . --fix

 # Run ruff in check-only mode (reports issues, doesn't modify files)
 ruff check .

 # Run black to format files explicitly (optional; ruff may already format)
 black .

 # pre-commit: install hooks for the repo
 pre-commit install

 # run all pre-commit hooks across the repo (use before PR)
 pre-commit run --all-files
 ```

 The repository's `pyproject.toml` includes ruff/black settings. Use `ruff check .` in CI to ensure code quality before merging.

 ## Tests

 Run tests with `pytest`:

 ```bash
 pytest -q
 ```

 ## Contributing checklist

 Before opening a PR:

 1. Ensure your `.env` is configured for local development (or your CI secrets are set).
 2. Run `pre-commit run --all-files` and fix issues.
 3. Run `ruff check .` (or `ruff check . --fix`) and `black .` as needed.
 4. Run tests: `pytest -q`.

 Thanks for contributing! If you want, I can also:

 - add a `.env.example` file to the repo with non-sensitive defaults,
 - add a GitHub Actions CI workflow that runs `ruff check .`, `pre-commit run --all-files`, and `pytest` on PRs.
# HealthAid — Backend

This directory contains the FastAPI backend for HealthAid. It provides the API, database models, migrations, and helper scripts used during development and deployment.

This README covers local setup, environment variables, running the app, and working with Alembic migrations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- A working database (sqlite for quick local use or Postgres for development/production)
- Recommended: a virtual environment (venv)

## Quick setup (local)

1. Create and activate a virtual environment

```zsh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies

```zsh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Provide environment variables

Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` or export variables in your shell. Minimum variables to set:

- DATABASE_URL — e.g. `sqlite+aiosqlite:///./dev.db` or a Postgres URL
- SECRET_KEY — a long random secret for signing

Example (in `backend/.env`):

```text
DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///./dev.db
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-here
```

4. Run database migrations (Alembic)

```zsh
cd backend
alembic upgrade head
```

If you don't have Alembic installed in your path, run it via the virtualenv's `alembic` script or with `python -m alembic`.

## Running the app (development)

Start the server with Uvicorn and auto-reload for development:

```zsh
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

By default the app will be available at `http://localhost:8000`. API docs are at `/docs` (Swagger UI) and `/redoc`.

## Running tests

Tests are in the repository `tests/` folder. From the repo root (with venv active):

```zsh
pytest -q
```

Add tests for any new backend logic and run them locally before opening PRs (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`).

## Alembic migrations

- Create a new migration after model changes:

```zsh
cd backend
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe change"
alembic upgrade head
```

- Migration files are stored in `backend/alembic/versions/`.

Coordinate migration changes with other developers to avoid merge conflicts.

## Secrets and security

- Keep `SECRET_KEY` and any API keys out of version control. Use `backend/.env` (gitignored) or a secrets manager.
- If you add AI provider keys (for the AI-first-aid feature), treat them as highly sensitive.

## Docker (optional)

There is a top-level `docker-compose.yml` that can be used to run the full stack including the backend. Check `docker-compose.yml` for service names, ports, and volumes.

## Useful developer scripts

- `secret_gen.py` — generate secure secret values for `SECRET_KEY`.
- `run.py` — convenience script for local runs (see file for behavior).

## Notes

- For configuration details, check `app/core/config.py` in the backend application for available settings and defaults.
- If you plan to deploy publicly, follow security best practices (TLS, DB backups, logging, access controls) and review relevant health-data regulations.
